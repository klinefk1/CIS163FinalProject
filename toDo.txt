Things that still need done:

	- make button work for Austin's instruction screen

	- screenShots: 2 - 8 @ min len 320px max len 3840px (I can do that)

	- Info for publishing:
		-Short description (up to 80 char)
		-Full description (up to 4000 char)


	I reread the thing about publishing and it will not allow it without at least 5 achievements, so let's pick the easiest 5 to implement and do that.  We can add more if we want later.
