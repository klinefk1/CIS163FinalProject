Things that still need done:

	- make button work for Austin's instruction screen

	- resize icon to 512x512 and .png (I can do that)
	- screenShots: 2 - 8 @ min len 320px max len 3840px (I can do that too)

	- Info for publishing:
		-Short description (up to 80 char)
		-Full description (up to 4000 char)


	I believe that is all...we don't need to do the achievements now.  We can do that later if we want to, but let's focus on getting this stuff together for now.
